## Features

* Auto-update script
* Reference / base default hud files
* Custom crosshairs, from [
TF2-Hud-Crosshairs](https://github.com/Hypnootize/TF2-Hud-Crosshairs)

Some of these features involve scripting or programs that are intended for windows.<br>
Where possible, linux is also supported (you may need wine to run the update script).

## Goals for this project:
As i'm now working with a auto-update hud, i would like to achieve minimal changes and its intended for casual players . <br>
Note: this will replace the original project [TeaHud](https://github.com/DrinkinTea22/TeaHud) but the hud will remain on 
my github account.
