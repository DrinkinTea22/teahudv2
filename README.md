Some of these features involve scripting or programs that are intended for windows.<br>
Where possible, linux is also supported (you may need wine to run the update script).

## Goals for this project:
As i'm now working with a auto-update hud, i would like to achieve minimal changes and its intended for casual players (for now). <br>
Note: this will replace the original project [TeaHud](https://github.com/DrinkinTea22/TeaHud) but the hud will remain on 
my github account.
