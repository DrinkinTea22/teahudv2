## Features

* Auto-update script
* Reference / base default hud files
* On-start and on-first-run cfg's
* Closecaption compiler
* chat_english language converter
* Animation fixes
* Animation locking setup
* Remove play-button background-dimmer option
* Preloaded cp icons (sv_pure compatible)
* Fixes for certain existing hud materials
* Custom basic shape materials
* Custom refract and blur materials with fallbacks

Some of these features involve scripting or programs that are intended for windows. Where possible, linux is also supported.

## Goals for this project:
As i'm now working with a auto-update hud, i would like to achieve minimal changes and its intended for casual players (for now)
Note: this will replace the original project [TeaHud](https://github.com/DrinkinTea22/TeaHud) but the hud will remain on 
my github account.
